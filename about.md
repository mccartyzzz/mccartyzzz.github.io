## About Github

  <span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

  Why do I love GitHub so much? When I joined GitHub, I was attracted to its simple website.As the development project continued to be used, GitHub felt more and more useful.It has an open source distributed version management system, a project-focused code base, and easy sharing of projects with others.Its convenience, simplicity and ease of use also attract more and more users.Here you can share your experience, learn the latest knowledge and work with others, and the most popular technology-related source code is also helpful for reference.Even create your own open source project, improve your programming skills, and create your own personal business card.


### Learning is also a journey of life

  <p>
  Learning is one of the most important abilities of human beings. Only those who keep learning can go higher and farther.No matter when, no matter where, as long as there will be people in the place of continuous efforts.I am 21 years old and will graduate from college soon, but I still feel confused about my life.You may feel awkward looking at these English, but please give me some support, because my English is not good, this is machine translation.I really want to be a part of a fluent English speaker, and I'm still trying.Keep learning ability to ensure competitiveness, so come on, after all, learning is also a journey in life.
